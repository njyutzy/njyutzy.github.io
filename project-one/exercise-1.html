<h2>OHNO BLAZEFACE</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/blazeface">Ohno Blazeface</a>) was designed in 2017 by James Edmondson. It’s part of the larger Ohno Type Company created by Edmondson in 2015. Blazeface is a fatface type style that was meant to be more “chill” than the others according to Edmondson. This mindset is similar to the (<a href="https://ohnotype.co/">Ohno family</a>) in general: a style of fonts created to challenge the norm and recreate a 70s vibe with a modern twist.</p>

    <h2>"Advocacy"</h2>
    <p>After advocating and demanding change for the killers of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black Americans earlier this year, LeBron spearheaded a campaign that went beyond protests.
<br><br>
Teaming up with the NAACP, LeBron and other athletes and artists’ were able to successfully register 10,000 volunteer poll workers in primarily Black voting districts as a part of their “More than a Vote” campaign.
<br><br>
Historically, LeBron has been a leading voice in speaking out to social injustice in America.
<br><br>
His outspokenness has been criticized by many and Fox News pundit even made remarks towards LeBron and other athletes saying, “Shut up and Dribble.”</p>

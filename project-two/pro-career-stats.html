    <h2>"Pro Career"</h2>
    <p>There’s no questioning the greatness of LeBron off the court, but perhaps the biggest reason why he’s been able to have that voice is because of his sustained greatness on the court.
<br><br>
Widely acclaimed as the best player in the world for the last 10+ years, LeBron has dominated the NBA and cemented his place in several all-time statistics.
<br><br>
He ranks third all-time in points scored, eighth all-time in assists and most recently won his fourth NBA championship and Finals MVP with the Los Angeles Lakers.
<br><br>
Many people still believe Michael Jordan is the best player of all time, but with a career year at the age of 35, LeBron may have a few more years to claim that highly sought after GOAT status. </p>

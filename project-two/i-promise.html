    <h2>"I Promise"</h2>

    <p>Getting off the ground in 2011, LeBron teamed up with the Akron Public Schools to provide the necessary resources and tools to 1,300 students from within the district.
      <br> <br>
      In addition, LeBron tapped on the shoulder of the University of Akron to help out with the program and they answered in a big way, promising every student who graduates a free tuition scholarship.
      <br> <br>
      LeBron has consistently claimed that this is his crowning achievement thus far in his life, beyond any accomplishment on the court. </p>

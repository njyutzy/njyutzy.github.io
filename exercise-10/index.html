    <h1>CAREER SUMMARY</h1>

    <h6>Senior communication major and graphic design minor at Goshen College from Iowa City, IA. Over the course of my four years at Goshen, I have played a large role as writer and editor for the student newspaper: The Record. My interest in graphic design manifested itself in an internship with LightBox, a graphic design collective in downtown Goshen.
  <br>
  <br>
  I value the experiences and connections I’ve made at GC deeply. Between classes abroad like ecological economics in Ecuador or class opportunities within Elkhart County like Inside Out, a class taken with residents of the Elkhart County Jail, I’ve grown to be a global citizen, caring for the world and all people living here.</h6>
